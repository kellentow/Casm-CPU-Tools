## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please go to [this link](https://github.com/kellentow/Casm-CPU-Tools/security/advisories/new) to report a vulnerability
if accepted I will start working on it and it should be fixed in the next update, in the mean time DO NOT share it
if declined it's probably too hard to read or doesn't describe it well enough, please resubmit with a better report
